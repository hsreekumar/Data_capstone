## <u>**Data Exploration**</u>
Data wrangling, text cleaning, basic sentiment analysis and word clouds are explored to identify the patterns in the available data.

#### Libraries
- **scikit-learn**: Used for preprocessing (e.g., StandardScaler), model evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall), and data splitting.
- **pandas**: For handling and manipulating structured data, especially for feature extraction.
- **nltk**: For text preprocessing (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization).
- **matplotlib**: For visualizing model performance (e.g., loss curves, accuracy plots).
- **wordcloud**: Used to visualize the most frequent words in the dataset, helping to understand the distribution of key terms in the text data.
- **VADER Sentiment**: A lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool, useful for quick sentiment scoring of text data.
- **sweetviz**: For generating comprehensive, automated EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) reports, providing visual insights into the structure and relationships within the dataset.
