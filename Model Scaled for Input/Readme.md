# **<u>Scaling the model to handle large inputs</u>**

**Batch Processing**: The DataLoader handles mini-batch processing by dividing the dataset into smaller batches (BATCH_SIZE), which helps in efficient memory management and accelerates training.

During training, each batch is loaded sequentially, allowing the model to process smaller chunks of data.

The shuffle=True parameter ensures that the data is shuffled at the start of each epoch, preventing the model from learning the order of the data.

Gradient clipping (nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_) is used to prevent exploding gradients by capping the gradients during backpropagation.

**Data Parallelism**: The model is wrapped with nn.DataParallel to parallelize it across multiple GPUs.

**Memory Management**: Efficient data loading with multiple worker threads. Avoid unnecessary large memory allocations.

The DataLoader is configured with multiple workers (num_workers=4). This allows for efficient data loading in parallel, reducing the CPU bottleneck and making better use of available memory.

Tensors are moved to the GPU (device) only when they are needed for computation. This prevents unnecessary memory usage on the GPU.
